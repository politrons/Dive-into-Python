r"""The Monad abstract base class.

All instances of the Monad typeclass should obey the three monad laws:

    1) Left identity: return a >>= f = f a
    2) Right identity: m >>= return = m
    3) Associativity: (m >>= f) >>= g = m >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)

        This is the mother of all methods. It's hard to describe what it
        does, because it can be used for pretty much anything:

        * Transformation, for projecting Monadic values and functions.
        * Composition, for composing monadic functions.
        * Chaining, for chaining of functions as a monadic value.
        * Combining, for combining monadic values.
        * Sequencing, of Monadic functions.
        * Flattening, of nested Monadic values.
        * Variable substitution, assign values to variables.

        The Monad doesnâ€™t specify what is happening, only that whatever
        is happening satisfies the laws of associativity and identity.

        Returns a new Monad.
